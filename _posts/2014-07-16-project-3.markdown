description: Learn the basics of programming and how to think computationally. I learned how to write programs that take inputs, process them, and produce outputs. I learned how to debug programs and how to solve programming problems. I learned how to express algorithms precisely using pseudo-code and control flow. I learned how to write Python programs that use variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and lists.
